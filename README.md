Automatically generate Javadoc from your Java project and publish it to GitHub Page.

## Requirements
- Your project need to use **Maven** or **Gradle**.

## Usage

### For Maven project

The workflow, usually declared in `.github/workflows/publish-javadoc.yml`, looks like:

<details open>

<summary>.github/workflows/publish-javadoc-maven.yml</summary>

```YAML
name: Deploy Javadoc

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy JavaDoc üöÄ
        uses: MathieuSoysal/Javadoc-publisher.yml@v2.4.0
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          javadoc-branch: javadoc
          java-version: 17
          target-folder: javadoc # url will be https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/javadoc, This can be left as nothing to generate javadocs in the root folder.
          project: maven # or gradle
          # subdirectories: moduleA moduleB #for subdirectories support, needs to be run with custom command
```
</details>

### For Gradle project

The workflow, usually declared in `.github/workflows/publish-javadoc.yml`, looks like:

<details open>
<summary>.github/workflows/publish-javadoc-gradle.yml</summary>



```YAML
name: Deploy Javadoc

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy JavaDoc üöÄ
        uses: MathieuSoysal/Javadoc-publisher.yml@v2.4.0
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          javadoc-branch: javadoc
          java-version: 17
          target-folder: javadoc 
          project: gradle
```
</details>

### With custom command for generating Javadoc

If you want to use a custom command for generating Javadoc, you can use the `custom-command` input. This input is a string that will be executed in the root of your project. For example, if you want to use the `javadoc` command, you can use the following workflow:

<details open>
<summary>.github/workflows/publish-javadoc-custom-command.yml</summary>

```YAML
name: Deploy Javadoc

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy JavaDoc üöÄ
        uses: MathieuSoysal/Javadoc-publisher.yml@v2.4.0
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          javadoc-branch: javadoc
          java-version: 17
          target-folder: javadoc 
          project: gradle
          custom-command: javadoc -d javadoc -sourcepath src/main/java -subpackages .
```
